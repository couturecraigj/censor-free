# censor-free

What could possibly go wrong

Imagine something that allows you to find friends post anything and have certain filters to protect prying eyes.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD026 -->

## Why?

<!-- markdownlint-enable -->

I am not alone in hating that people are being censored just because they
have a certain point of view.
