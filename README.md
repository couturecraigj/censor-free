# censor-free

What could possibly go wrong

Imagine something that allows you to find friends post anything and have certain ratings to protect people from seeing things that they do not
want to see.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD026 -->

## Why?

<!-- markdownlint-enable -->

I am not alone in hating that people are being censored just because they
have a certain point of view. Also, we all hate that a certain social
network gave away what should have been private data to certain groups.
Lets also not forget that we want to have an open and free internet.
